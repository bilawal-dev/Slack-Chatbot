# Development Summary (as of July 28, 2024)

This document summarizes the key architectural decisions, database schema changes, and API endpoints implemented in the project.

## 1. Core Architecture

The application is designed to use Slack for real-time messaging, while the backend manages user data, locations (from ClickUp), and thread metadata.

-   **Backend**: Node.js with Express.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL, managed with Prisma ORM.
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication is required for all chat-related endpoints.

## 2. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

The database schema was updated to support thread management.

### `User` Model
- A one-to-many relationship was added to the `Thread` model.

### `Thread` Model
A new model, `Thread`, was created to store metadata about conversations.

```prisma
model Thread {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  user          User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId        String
  locationId    String   // This will be the listId inside the folder from ClickUp
  folderId      String   // ClickUp folder ID
  name          String?
  slackThreadTs String?  // Slackâ€™s thread key, can be optional initially
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

A migration (`20250727214723_add_thread_model`) was created and applied to sync the database with this schema.

## 3. API Endpoints

All chat-related endpoints are grouped under the `/api/chat/` path and are protected by the `AuthenticateToken` middleware.

### Locations

#### `GET /api/chat/locations/:folderId`
-   **Description**: Fetches a list of locations (represented as lists in ClickUp) within a specific folder. It also includes a count of how many threads the authenticated user has for each location.
-   **Controller**: `ChatController.getListsInFolder`
-   **Response Example**:
    ```json
    {
      "success": true,
      "message": "Lists for folder 9013... fetched successfully",
      "data": [
        {
          "listId": "901316852460",
          "name": "Forest Crumbl",
          "threadCount": 0
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### Threads (CRUD)

#### `POST /api/chat/threads`
-   **Description**: Creates a new thread associated with the authenticated user.
-   **Controller**: `ChatController.createThread`
-   **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "listId": "string",
      "folderId": "string",
      "name": "string (optional)"
    }
    ```

#### `GET /api/chat/threads/:listId`
-   **Description**: Retrieves all threads for a specific location (`listId`) that belong to the authenticated user.
-   **Controller**: `ChatController.getThreads`

#### `PUT /api/chat/threads/:threadId`
-   **Description**: Updates the name of a specific thread.
-   **Controller**: `ChatController.updateThread`
-   **Authorization**: Checks if the authenticated user is the owner of the thread before updating.
-   **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "string"
    }
    ```

#### `DELETE /api/chat/threads/:threadId`
-   **Description**: Deletes a specific thread.
-   **Controller**: `ChatController.deleteThread`
-   **Authorization**: Checks if the authenticated user is the owner of the thread before deleting.

## 4. Key Implementation Details

-   **`ChatController.js`**: Contains all business logic for handling locations and threads, including fetching data from the ClickUp API and performing database operations with Prisma.
-   **`ChatRoutes.js`**: Defines all the API routes and maps them to the corresponding controller functions.
-   **Ownership Checks**: All thread-related operations (`update`, `delete`) include checks to ensure that a user can only modify their own data, enhancing security.
